Exercise 2 - Pipe that Line
1.
Max_Delay=max(CLK_to_Q_Delay+Adder_Delay+Setup_Time,
                CLK_to_Q_Delay+multiplication_Delay+Setup_Time)
         =max(10ns+45ns+10ns,10ns+60ns+10ns)
         =80ns

2.
Min_Period=Max_Delay=80ns
Max_Freq
    =1/Min_Period
    =1/80ns
    =12.5MHz

Q.why we don’t need any “bubbles” for our pipelined circuit?
A.A pipeline bubble is needed when a stage depends on the result of a previous stage that is not yet available.
    In this circuit:
        The multiplication stage uses only the external inputs — it does not depend on the state.
        The addition stage uses:
            The product from the multiplication stage (computed in the previous cycle)
            The state from the previous addition stage (stored in a register)
        Since both values are available at the start of the addition stage, no waiting is required.
