1.The register representing the variable k.
Register: t0
Explanation:
    Initialized to 0 (addi t0, x0, 0).
    Incremented in the loop (addi t0, t0, 1).
    Used to calculate array indices (slli s3, t0, 2).

2.The register representing the variable sum.
Register: s0
Explanation:
    Initialized to 0 (addi s0, x0, 0).
    Updated in the loop (add s0, s0, t2), where t2 holds fun(source[k]).

3.The registers acting as pointers to the source and dest arrays.
source Pointer: s1
    Loaded via la s1, source (base address of source).
dest Pointer: s2
    Loaded via la s2, dest (base address of dest).
4.The assembly code for the loop found in the C code.
Loop Label: loop:
Key Instructions:
assembly
loop:
    slli s3, t0, 2          ; Calculate byte offset (k * 4)
    add t1, s1, s3          ; t1 = &source[k]
    lw t2, 0(t1)            ; Load source[k] into t2
    beq t2, x0, exit        ; Exit if source[k] == 0
    add a0, x0, t2          ; Pass source[k] as argument to fun
    jal fun                 ; Call fun(source[k])
    add t2, x0, a0          ; Store result in t2
    add t3, s2, s3          ; t3 = &dest[k]
    sw t2, 0(t3)            ; dest[k] = fun(source[k])
    add s0, s0, t2          ; sum += fun(source[k])
    addi t0, t0, 1          ; k++
    jal x0, loop            ; Jump back to loop

5.How the pointers are manipulated in the assembly code.
Strategy:
    Base addresses (s1 for source, s2 for dest) remain fixed.
    Byte offset (s3 = k * 4) is computed for each iteration (slli s3, t0, 2).
    Element addresses are calculated dynamically:
        source[k]: t1 = s1 + s3
        dest[k]: t3 = s2 + s3

Key Operations:
    Load: lw t2, 0(t1) reads source[k].
    Store: sw t2, 0(t3) writes to dest[k].

Efficiency:
    Offset recalculation (s3 = k * 4) and address addition (s1 + s3/s2 + s3) occur per iteration.
    Base registers (s1, s2) are preserved across the loop.
