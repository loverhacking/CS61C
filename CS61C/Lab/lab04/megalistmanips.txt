1. line 69  add t1, s0, x0
fix: lw t1, 0(s0)
reason: should read 4 bytes from memory address s0, instead of
copying value in register s0.

2. line 72  add t1, t1, t0
fix:
    slli t3, t0, 2
    add t1, t1, t3
    lw a0, 0(t1)
reason: t0 is an element index (0,1,2,...),
but it is not multiplied by 4 (the integer occupies 4 bytes),
resulting in an error in the address calculation

3. line 82  la a0, 8(s0)
fix: lw a0, 8(s0)
reason: What is loaded is the "address of the next pointer field" (i.e., s0+8),
not the address of the next node.

4. line 83  lw a1, 0(s1)
fix: mv a1, s1
reason: s1 stores the function address,
but lw a1,0 (s1) mistakenly loads the first instruction of the function
instead of the function address.

5. line 76 jalr s1
fix: store t1, t2 before calling f
reason: t1 (array base) and t2 (array size) are temporary registers,
but the mystery function may use t1 and t2, which destroys their values,
causing errors in subsequent loops.
