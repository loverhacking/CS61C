1.Which target is part of a rule that deletes all the compiled programs?
Target: clean
  Reason: The clean rule explicitly removes $(BINARIES) (which contains all compiled programs) via -rm -rf ... $(BINARIES) ....
2.Which target is part of a rule that makes all the compiled programs?
Target: all
Reason: The all target depends on $(BINARIES) (which expands to vector-test bit_ops lfsr), triggering their compilation.
3.Which compiler is currently being used?
  Compiler: gcc
  Reason: The CC and LD variables are explicitly set to gcc.
4.What C standard are we currently using?
  Standard: C99
  Reason: The CFLAGS variable includes -std=c99.
5.How would we reference a variable “FOO” in a makefile?
  Syntax: $(FOO)
  Reason: Makefile variables are referenced using $(VARIABLE_NAME) syntax (e.g., $(CC) or $(BINARIES)).
6.What operating system does the term “Darwin” represent?
  OS: macOS (or Mac OS X)
  Reason: Darwin is the Unix-based core of macOS, detected here for Valgrind configuration.
7.What line creates the lfsr program from its object files?
  Line number: 32
  Reason: The rule for $(LFSR_PROG) (which is lfsr) links the object files $(LFSR_OBJS) into the executable on line 32:
